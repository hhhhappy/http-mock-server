# http-mock-server
 A simple http mock server, based on [Gin](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin) framework.

Can be used in **Linux** , **Windows** and **Mac**. 

*For Mac version, I  don't have a Mac yet (It's freaking expensive...), so I never test it , sorry for that. Hopefully it will work.*

Bug life is a lifestyle of developer. 

So if there is any issues, please report it, I will resolve it as soon as possible.

## How to use?

Or execute `http-mock-server.exe` in CLI.

```

## Configure

You can find configure file in `config/config.yml`

Its content will be:

```yaml
port: 8588    # Define the listen Port
logPath: ./   # Log output directory
urlList:          # Define your listen URL
    # Custom Url
    # With this value, final url will be http://<ip>:<port>/mock_http/callback
  - url: callback_html

    # HTTP Method:
    # Only support GET and POST for now
    type: post

    # Custom Return Body's Filepath:
    # You can DIY body of return request by creating a body file
    returnBodyFile: ./config/callback.html

    # Custom return Header:
    # You can DIY header of return request
    header:
      version: 1.220
      session: ab2b1aab2cce31111

  - url: callback_string
    type: get
    returnBodyFile: ./config/callback_string

  - url: callback_file
    type: get
    returnBodyFile: ./config/callback_file.jpg
```

Explanation:

- ***port***: http server listen port
- ***logPath***: where should it put log files
- ***urlList***: definition of mock http URL, you can define multiple URL here.
  - ***url***: base of URL
    - `mock_http` is fixed string, can not be changed for now.
    - For example:  `callback`  => `http://<ip>:<port>/mock_http/callback`
  - ***type***: HTTP Method of URL, only support **POST** and **GET** for now
  - ***returnBodyFile***: Custom Return Body's filepath, You can DIY body of return request by creating a body file
  - ***header***: Custom return Header

## Log Request

Content of all requests will be saved in files (*.request). Filename is based on your custom url. 

For example, I defined URL `/mock_http/callback2`, after sending requests, a file `callback2.request` will be created in current directory. 

It's content will be:

```bash
2019/09/06 14:01:05 
[Method]
POST

[Query] 
{}

[Header]
{
    "Accept": [
        "*/*"
    ],

        "gzip, deflate"
    ],
